# Eagle-Libraries
Eagle libraries of parts I've created over the years.  Hopefully you find something you need.

The goal here is to eventually split the library up into different categories for ease of use, but for now I'm cleaning the place up and getting rid of redundant packages and whatnot.  Once EAGLE adds the ability to share managed libraries I'll also add that link here.
